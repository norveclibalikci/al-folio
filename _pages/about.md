Yet another stereotypical personal website. I started PhD at [UNC CS](https://cs.unc.edu){:target="\_blank"} in 2019 Fall. I work with [Marc Niethammer](http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/~mn/){:target="\_blank"}, we work on handful of topics such as: image registration, data augmentation, optimal mass transport, machine learning and computer vision. 
Before I came UNC CS, I worked in [Dcipher Analytics](https://www.dcipheranalytics.com) as an Machine Learning Engineer, and I worked in [ITU Vision Lab](http://vision.itu.edu.tr) with Gozde Unal, we focused on medical image synthesis, medical image segmentation. I served as a teaching assistant for Deep Learning course in ITU, I prepared assignment and helped syllabus creation.

 [CV](/al-folio/assets/pdf/SahinOlut_CV.pdf).

After those unnecessary details, I'm planning to share my inspirations here.
